    <string name="helpText"><u>"Introduction"</u>
        \n"The background generator is intended to remove the creative pressure that can sometimes frustrate players as they try to flesh out the murky details of their characters’ backgrounds."
        \n"This app automates the Open Game License rules and random tables found in the Pathfinder Reference Document and Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign for creating backstories, with optional content for games set in Golarion's Inner Sea Region from Quests and Campaigns."
        \n
        \n<u>"Rules"</u>
        \n"Depending on your rolls on the generator's tables you are sometimes granted access to a trait, story feat, or drawback. These are typically marked in "<b>"bold"</b>"."
        \n"At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you've gained access to."
        \n"If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection)."
        \n"When you gain access to a story feat, it means you've met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation."

    <string-array name="racialInfo">
        <item><u>Dwarves</u>\nMany dwarves come from industrious and tight-knit communities of like-minded individuals who work together to accomplish a common goal.</item>
        <item><u>Elves</u>\nElves are often raised in insular elven communities, and the longevity of these people means that elven children often grow up with the help of a large social network.</item>
        <item><u>Gnomes</u>\nThe capricious and carefree gnomes of the world are widespread and varied. They typically either form their own gnome communities or integrate themselves into other humanoid societies.</item>
        <item><u>Half-Elves</u>\nBorn of two very different worlds, half-elves rarely have easy childhoods. Torn as half-elves are between disparate peoples, the presence of their families helps ensure they do not grow up totally alone, though orphaned half-elves have to create families of their own.</item>
        <item><u>Half-Orcs</u>\nOnly rarely the result of a happy union between the humans and orcs that bring them into the world, half-orcs are often regarded as monsters. This bleak reality makes those rare half-orcs, cherished as much as the young of any other race, even more extraordinary.</item>
        <item><u>Halflings</u>\nSocial and amicable by nature, halflings fit equally well in both communities of humans and those of their wily kinsfolk. Prone to wanderlust, halflings can be found anywhere civilized humanoids settle.</item>
        <item><u>Humans</u>\nAs diverse as they are widespread, humans tend to grow up in small or large societies of people with similar origins and histories, though individuals’ paths may run the gamut from idealized to tragic.</item>

        <item>Fell in with a Bad Crowd\nIn your youth, you ran with a brutal, evil, or sadistic crowd. You might have belonged to a gang, a thieves’ guild, or some other nefarious organization.

        <item>Ordinary Childhood\nYour childhood was fairly ordinary, with no major blessing or catastrophe—a stark contrast to an adventuring life.

    <string-array name="trainingAlchemist">
        <item><u>Training: Alchemist</u>\n<i>Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.\nWhat was the catalyst in the grand reaction that transfigured you into an Alchemist?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Accidental Discovery\nYour keen intellect has always been an asset in your studies of the alchemical arts, but along with your logic and rationale, you have a “sense” for alchemy. This intuition sometimes leads to discoveries through methods most of your peers would never have thought possible, but that you somehow know will work.\nYou gain access to the <b>Alchemical Intuition</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Firebug\nAlthough you’ve studied all aspects of the alchemist’s craft, your have a talent for fire. Fire has always been a seductive and powerful force that you have either embraced with glee or focused care. You are adept at exploiting a weakness to fire when you recognize it.\nYou gain access to the <b>Focused Burn</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Wasn’t Strong Enough\nYou suffered something at an early age that made you feel powerless. Maybe a relative died from plague, a friend was crushed beneath rubble you were too weak to move, or some other horrible tragedy occurred. You turned to alchemy to transcend the limitations of your physical form. Your relentless dedication has made your bolstering abilities more persistent.\nYou gain access to the <b>Enduring Mutagen</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Magic for the Uninclined\nYou were always interested in the arcane, but lacked the innate magic of sorcerers or the single-minded dedication possessed by wizards. As a disciple of science, the magic of faith was also closed to you. You dedicated yourself to alchemy, focusing on extracts that mimic the magic you once hoped to wield. That original interest in magic still grants you occasional rare insight into the workings of your formulae.\nYou gain access to the <b>Cross-Knowledge</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Master Craftsman\nThe first time you saw air mix with the shapeless goo of a tanglefoot bag or shielded your eyes at the heatless light of a sunrod, you became ensnared by the wonders of alchemy. You’ve since labored to learn the secrets to crafting such items.\nYou gain access to the <b>Alchemical Adept</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Physician\nAlchemy was the natural outgrowth of your time spent learning the healer’s craft. Your first extracts were the accidental byproduct of making poultices and elixirs. Continuing your studies, you found the natural compassion you had as a healer mixing with an alchemist’s cold logic, forging you into a clinician unlike most others.\nYou gain access to the <b>Precise Treatment</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Formulae Stickler\nTo you, alchemy is a delicate and complex symphony requiring multiple different elements to work together to produce the perfect result. Though others in your craft come up with ways to substitute certain ingredients when making bombs or mutagens, you disdain such practices, deeming them pollutions. To you, there is always a perfect ingredient and its addition makes your alchemy more potent.\nYou gain access to the <b>Meticulous Concoction</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Nature’s Foe\nYou lost something or someone important to you through the cruel indifference of nature. Perhaps you watched someone get swallowed by a storm-tossed sea or witnessed a summer forest fire destroy your home and all of your possessions. No matter the impetus, the unpredictability of nature made you feel small and helpless. Your subsequent devotion to alchemy has been in no small part due to a desire to exert control over nature itself, a domineering intent palpable to all creatures of nature.\nYou gain access to the <b>Unnatural Revenge</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>To Recreate a Miracle\nYour life or the life of someone you loved was saved by a magical elixir. Witnessing this instilled a sense of awe for the art of alchemy. Although your research has not yet been able to recreate the sheer potency of that draught long ago, your years questing to duplicate it have made you adept at brewing potions.\nYou gain access to the <b>Perfectionist’s Brew</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Mad Alchemist\nRampant curiosity and a near fearlessness of the unknown drove you to experiment with the rudiments of alchemy. That curiosity has uncovered interesting alchemical secrets, at the cost of alchemical instability. Some consider your experiments mad.\nYou gain access to the <b>Unstable Mutagen</b> magic trait.</item>

    <string-array name="trainingBarbarian">
        <item><u>Training: Barbarian</u>\n<i>Barbarians are fueled by an almost supernatural rage that helps them loose the volatile stores of adrenaline within their bodies. This rage stays with the barbarian throughout her life as an adventurer, and she learns to refine her fits of passionate anger only over time. Yet each barbarian’s rage is different and personal. It comes from the primal depths of her soul, and cannot be manufactured. Only a select few can channel that purest, deepest rage into overpowering combat prowess.\nWhat event lit the spark for the fires of your first mighty rage?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Vengeance\nWhen you were young, a great wrong was done to you, a loved one, your family, or your people. This experience tore you apart and reduced you to a being of primal emotions. Dreams of vengeance became your only promise of comfort.\nYou gain access to the <b>Axe to Grind</b> combat trait, the <b>Foeslayer</b> story feat, and the <b>Vengeance</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Champion of a God\nAt your coming-of-age ritual, your deity, totem, or patron spirit sparked your soul with a religious zeal. This entity might be a beast spirit, a warmongering god, a demon lord, or some other supernatural entity. In the name of this otherworldly force you become an unstoppable warrior—the bane of all your tribe’s foes.\nYou gain access to the <b>Inspired</b> faith trait and the Champion story feat.</item>
        <item>Conquest\nUpon coming of age, you went on your first raid, where you learned the thrill of violence and chaos and the satisfaction that came with the spoils of your victory. When your enemies dare to stand against you, your rage rekindles until you have conquered and subdued them.\nYou gain access to the <b>Killer</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Hated Foe\nIn your formative years, you learned to despise a certain individual, tribe, kingdom, empire, race, or monster due to some slight it inflicted upon you or your people. This foe lurks ever close to your thoughts. So intense is your hatred that the mere thought of this foe can incite your rage.\nYou gain access to the <b>Reckless</b> combat trait and the <b>Foeslayer</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Personal Flaw\nThere is a part of yourself that you hate more than anything else. In your adolescence, you first realized this imperfection—to your lasting shame. This might be a gentle part of yourself you wish to eliminate or a brutal, prideful, greedy, or monstrous side you can’t control. Your rage is fueled by self-loathing, or by projecting this part of yourself onto a foe you wish to destroy.\nYou gain access to the <b>Axe to Grind</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Hatred of Civilization\nWhen you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you. Once, such people were free and strong, but rules and laws made them feeble. Your rage is the wild part—the pure part—of yourself that separates you from the craven ways of “civilized” people.\nYou gain access to the <b>Savage</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Persecution\nYou grew up under the persecution of another power—perhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors.\nYou gain access to the <b>Bullied</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>One of a Dying Breed\nYou grew up knowing that your people were slowly dying out—that your extinction was inevitable in the face of the changing world. In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you rage, a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you’re going down, you’re taking everyone with you.\nYou gain access to the <b>Reactionary</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Chaos Embraced\nYou grew up in wild lands where there were no laws except for those of nature—the laws of the predator and the prey. You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that’s how you like it.\nYou gain access to the <b>Unpredictable</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Bloodthirsty\nThe first time you spilled a deserving foe’s blood and watched the thing’s life ebb out onto the hard ground, you found yourself filled with a mad, euphoric ecstasy like none other. The memory of this visceral experience returns to you in every battle, like an insatiable addiction that can only be abated with further bloodshed.\nYou gain access to the <b>Bloodthirsty</b> combat trait and the <b>Innocent Blood</b> story feat.</item>

Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.\nWhich siren song led you to developing your own story of the ages?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Celebrity\nIn your formative years, you saw a player or troupe of players perform before an enthralled audience.

        <item>Cultural Mandate\nThere has always been a revered storyteller in your culture. This could be an official skald, a royal minstrel, the washerman who spins parables and folk wisdom, or the old farmer who tells tall tales at the pub. Ever since you were young, your community has groomed you to fulfill this role.\nAs a silver-tongued storyteller, you gain access to the <b>Fast Talker</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Dabbler\nWhether you grew up rich or poor, you refused to accept the limits imposed by your social class or means.

        <item>Ongoing Patron\nWhen you were young, a person with money or power took an interest in your art and sponsored you.

        <item>Spy\nSomeone once asked you to employ your artistic talents as an excuse to observe a person, steal an object, or retrieve a piece of information.

These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner.

Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. The particular path that steers a cleric toward her faith can mean the difference between a demon-worshiping cultist and a lawful harbinger of her deity’s blessed faith.\nMerciful healer, keeper of order, devotee of knowledge, scion of the abyss...what drove you to your faith?</i>\n</item>

        <item>Sanctuary\nWhen you were young, you did a very wicked deed—or were accused of one—and fled to the only place that could shelter you from the law.

        <item>Lost in the Wild\nYou got lost in the wilderness and were forced to survive on your own. You may have wandered desert dunes, thick forest, or high mountains—or perhaps you were shipwrecked on a desert island.

        <item>Gladiator\nAs an adolescent, you learned to fight and kill because your master made you, and if you had not learned, you would be dead. Killing was a way of life—a means of survival.

        <item>Joined the Watch\nYour village, town, city, or tribe needed new recruits for the volunteer watch patrol, and you joined up—whether for money, duty, peace, or power.

        <item>Knighted\nYour military path began when you were knighted or made a squire to a knight.

        <item>Mercenary\nEveryone needs to earn a living, and in your youth you were fast, strong, or tough enough to fight for pay.

        <item>On the Street\nYou spent adolescence in a seedy part of town. You learned to fight dirty and fight mean. Turns out you were good at it.

        <item>Survival\nYou spent some part of your life in the wild—in places that abide by the laws of nature rather than those of civilization.

    <string-array name="trainingGunslinger">
        <item><u>Training: Gunslinger</u>\n<i>Armed with dangerous, emergent technology and blessed with death-defying luck and skill, gunslingers are practically born to be legends. But for every gunslinger who rises to epic fame as a hero or villain, another has been left lifeless at the hands of the weapon she sought to master. Regardless of this destiny, however, no other class is so wedded and intrinsically linked to a single kind of weapon as the gunslinger. How she came to possess, learn, and master the unique power of firearms forms the backbone of every gunslinger‘s current motivations.\nHow did the smell of gunpowder and the deafening roar of the boomstick leave its mark on you?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Any Fool Can Swing a Sword\nSometime during your youth, you came to the conclusion that most melee and ranged weapons are crude and primitive compared to firearms. It puzzles you that anyone with martial aptitude deigns to devote their skill to anything other than firearms. You disregard such “lesser” weapons and prefer the feel of your trusty firearm over any other tool of war.\nYou gain access to the <b>Reckless Contempt</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Bucking Tradition\nYou come from a proud tradition of ancient arms and august codes of conduct like those followed by paladins, cavaliers, and samurai. Instead of following in the vaunted steps of your predecessors, though, you chose to learn the art of firearms to the shock and perhaps even anger of your family and peers. Your break with tradition fostered in you a nearly insurmountable will that fuels your identity as a gunslinger.\nYou gain access to the <b>Resolve of the Rejected</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Custodian of the Future\nFirearms are not just an effective implement for killing or a curious mechanical trinket; they are the next step in the technological development of your people. Your passion for the workings of your weapons has you constantly assembling and dismantling firearms to truly understand their mechanics. This ongoing dedication improves your ability to repair firearms and make them deadlier while in your skilled hands.\nYou gain access to the <b>Unblemished Barrel</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Defining Moment\nGuns are inexorably linked to a moment where your life dramatically changed. Perhaps you were so sickly as a child that you couldn’t turn a crossbow’s winch or bend a bow, but firearms showed you that you could still hunt and fight. Perhaps you picked up a firearm in a desperate moment to help a wounded gunslinger and knew that you had just taken your first step along the same path. A firearm at your side instills in you a sense of purpose and destiny that no one can take away.\nYou gain access to the <b>Black Powder Fortune</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Look at What I Can Do\nThe lure of something new and showy drove you to first pick up a gun. Although several near mishaps taught you to respect the volatile weapon and the powder that powers it, you still enjoy doing trick shots and getting the oohs and aahs of a crowd.\nYou gain access to the <b>Black Powder Bravado</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Mechanical Savant\nFor you, the lure of firearms is not the effect they produce, but the science and mechanical process behind the effect. Your endless tinkering and perfectionism have made your own gun easier to upgrade.\nYou gain access to the <b>Just Like New</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Black Powder Presence\nYou grew up belittled and even beaten for not being the biggest or the strongest of your compatriots, family, or race. With no burgeoning aptitude for magic, you looked for some other way to exceed those who found superiority in brute strength—and you found it in gunslinging.\nYou gain access to the <b>Larger Than Life</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Sacred Charge\nYour gunslinger training is more than just martial skill—it’s a calling. Perhaps you are part of an elite group of guards serving and defending a temple or faith. Conversely, you might come from a land where firearms represent the pinnacle of your society’s advancement or are the last vestige of those who came before. Your sense of higher purpose allows you to fight on and keep firing when winning seems impossible.\nYou gain access to the <b>Never Stop Shooting</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Shock and Awe\nThe sound and fury of gunfire is as potent a weapon as the pellets and bullets your weapon discharges. You live for the reflexive wince that others make when they jump at the sound of a firearm, and laugh heartily at the amazement you inspire in others with your cacophonous black-powder weapons.\nYou gain access to the <b>Startling Report</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Some Things Are Stronger Than Magic\nYou grew up either oppressed by magic cruelly wielded or loathing the elitism of those who possessed such arcane or divine power.

    <string-array name="trainingInquisitor">
        <item><u>Training: Inquisitor</u>\n<i>Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, less concerned the theological and metaphysical aspects of faith and belief than what they consider to be the harsh realities of defending that faith.\nWhat event made you temper your faith with stern judgement?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Bureaucracy’s Bane\nYou chose the inquisitor‘s path because you have no taste for the petty rules and regulations that mire the leaders of your faith in inaction and inefficacy. You know that you are an instrument of your deity and that your directives do not require intercession by the less motivated. \nYou gain access to the <b>Focused Disciple</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Chaplain\nYou learned long ago that in the heat of battle and under the pall of war, even the most devout can waiver in faith.

        <item>Exemplar\nYou found early on that you lacked the logic or the vocabulary to communicate the virtues of faith—more precisely, your faith—to others.

        <item>Failed Cleric\nYour original training in divine magic was as a cleric, but your faith eventually distilled into you the ability to hear lies and see weaknesses in the “unfaithful.” \nYou gain access to the <b>Schooled Inquisitor</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Faith-Bringer\nYou know that in order to bring the light of your deity to others, you must traverse hostile territories and face even more hostile inhabitants. \nYou gain access to the <b>Weathered Emissary</b> social trait and the <b>Fearless Zeal</b> story feat.</item>

        <item>Few Left to Safeguard the Faith\nYou are the vanguard of your faith. Perhaps you are a pilgrim for a good deity in an unholy land, or the secret enforcer of a sect that operates in the shadows of the world. You are accustomed to working alone and with little guidance from the superiors of your church, trusting your own moral judgement to act on behalf of your god. This certainty acts as a defense against the magic of other, “lesser” deities. \nYou gain access to the <b>Disdainful Defender</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Temple Detective\nYour ability to sniff out falsehood and see weakness in others made you uniquely suited to guard the religious houses of your order. \nYou gain access to the <b>Truth’s Agent</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>The Path of Righteous Rage\nYour faith does not manifest in calm prayer or serene meditation. You achieve the transcendent feeling of the divine when you are in the throes of battle for your deity. \nYou gain access to the <b>Indelible Ire</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Zealot\nYour devotion is fanatical and your powers are clearly proof of your connection with the divine.

    <string-array name="trainingMagus">
        <item><u>Training: Magus</u>\n<i>There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their time perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without equal. The magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a discipline in which both spell and steel are used to devastating effect.\nWhat drove you to blur the lines between the martial and the arcane?</i>\n</item>
        <item>A Mage without Magic\nEarly in your arcane training, you were exposed to antimagic. The powerlessness you felt from all of your magic being stripped away left you feeling desperate and helpless. You vowed to never be that helpless child again, to be strong in such moments, putting you on the path of the magus. \nYou gain access to the <b>Dispelled Battler</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Conflicting Legacy\nYou were born to a family or clan with two great pedigrees: one of magic and one of battle. Unable to choose either path for fear of alienating a mentor or parent, you sought to master both. Your dedication to the blending of martial and magical has been so intense that your martial prowess feeds your arcane power. \nYou gain access to the <b>Arcane Revitalization</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Ready for Anything\nFor you, the path of the magus is not about the fluid blend of disparate fields of study or conquering an insurmountable challenge, but the art of preparation for any obstacle that comes your way. a dedicated and logical person, you hone the magus affinity for operating all manner of magical devices from blind luck to a refined procedure. \nYou gain access to the <b>Pragmatic Activator</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Lost Teacher\nYour magus training was interrupted when you lost your teacher through the displacement of your family, lack of funds to continue schooling, or the teacher’s unexpected death. Despite this hardship, the time you spent with your mentor had already sown the seeds of your training and you’ve been able to continue on your own in the time since—ceaselessly seeking, reading, and learning from any magical text you can find. \nYou gain access to the <b>Self-Taught Scholar</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Promise Keeper\nYour dreams of becoming a wizard were cut short by unfortunate circumstances, such as the death of your family or clan’s matriarch or patriarch, hostile invading forces, conscription in the army, and so on. This forced you to become a protector and stunted the growth of your studies. Though you have successfully blended the two disciplines, you still long for the unfulfilled potential of your career as a wizard. \nYou gain access to the <b>Cross-Disciplined</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Shameful Secret\nYou come from either a proud military and martial background or a legacy of skilled wizards. When you developed an aptitude for two different powers viewed as incompatible by your family or teachers, it drove you to hide half of your abilities and to pretend full-blown competency with the other. Some of the tricks you used to perpetrate this deception have stayed with you to this day. \nYou gain access to the <b>Partial Protege</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Spell Backfire\nAt some point during your magical training, you attempted to cast a spell and failed. But rather than being wasted, the arcane energy reabsorbed itself into your body, waiting to be reused in some other way. When the arcane energy exploded outward through your staff or some other instrument you wielded, you received your first glimpse of the ways that magic could be repurposed—a versatility you retain today. \nYou gain access to the <b>Malleable Magic</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Spell’s Edge\nThe first time you held a magic weapon and felt the thrum of arcane energy within, you knew that magic and melee were meant to be joined. Since that moment, magic weaponry has become symbolic of the most potent syntheses of your magus training, and your ability to create magical weapons and imbue mundane arms with magic still resonates with this focus. \nYou gain access to the <b>Bladed Magic</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Vindication\nYou spent your formative years trying to convince combat instructors of the virtues of magic and arcane mentors of the importance of strength in arms, only to be mocked and exiled from both disciplines. Since then, you’ve wandered from master to master, honing your knowledge of both fields of study to show them all that not only have you achieved power, but you’ve also eclipsed all those who shunned you. \nYou gain access to the <b>Arcane Temper</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>What If\nYou don’t know the meaning of impossible. Everyone around you thinks you have your head stuck in the clouds, but you continually strive to achieve things that have never been accomplished before—perhaps things that have never even been dreamed of.

        <item>Nature’s Disciple\nJust as many great masters learned and crafted styles from the beauty and majesty of nature, your fighting style comes from time spent in the wild rather than from formal training.

Some hear the whispers of celestial beings in their minds, while other are drawn down the path of the paladin by tragedy and a sincere desire to strike a blow to the evil that stalks the world. Paladins sometimes take on younger charges such as orphans or runaways during their journeys, and the seeds of goodness can be sowed into these impressionable youths to grow another knight on the quest for righteousness.\nWhat makes you worthy to lead the crusade against evil?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Divine Calling\nAn otherworldly agent of law and good—such as an angel, empyreal lord, or perhaps some other celestial envoy of the gods—tasked you to be a divine champion. You accepted the calling (maybe grudgingly) because ultimately you realize that the laws of destiny and one’s divine calling cannot be denied. In return, that celestial agent watches over you and makes sure you can fully realize your destiny and meet the course that has been set for you by a higher power. \nYou gain access to the <b>Blessed</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Dread Penance\nYou, or perhaps your family, owe a debt for some past wrongdoing or vice. Maybe you made deals with some unscrupulous loan sharks during a gambling binge or your not-so-distant ancestors were responsible for the persecution of a marginalized group of people. Whatever the offense, your past action hangs over your head and fills you with guilt. You’ve taken a solemn oath to make good on this past misdeed. Only then will you feel like your life is truly worthwhile. \nYou gain access to the <b>Oathbound</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Holy Epiphany\nYour faith and purpose came in a brilliant flash of insight. Maybe you suddenly realized that evil can be stopped only with vigilance and deliberate action, or maybe an epiphany showed you that the innocent need protection from corrupt forces for good to flourish in the world. Whatever the nature of your epiphany, it guides your actions and gives you insights others lack. \nYou gain access to the <b>Inspired</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Zealous Devotion\nMaybe your faith was not popular among those around you during your youth. Maybe you have strange or controversial views regarding your religion, and the other members of your congregation find your practices bizarre or insulting. Whatever the case, your faith is constantly being questioned regardless of your obviously pious nature, and such persecution only serves to embolden your zeal. \nYou gain access to the <b>Indomitable Faith</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Moral Debt\nThe world and all things material are intrinsically corrupt. All creatures are born with a moral debt, and only by fighting evil, upholding law, and championing the common good can one be truly free of that corruption. You work every day to pay off this debt and move those around you to do the same. \nYou gain access to the <b>Principled</b> faith trait and the <b>Fearless Zeal</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Mark of Faith\nYou were born with the mark of your faith. Maybe at some point you rebelled against such branding, or it could be you’ve always accepted the mark as an indicator of your destiny. In either case, it was a harbinger of the paladin path. \nYou gain access to the <b>Birthmark</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Righteous Mentor\nA paladin of note and great honor took you under her wing and taught you many things. She taught you how to adhere to your oath with grace and dignity, and how the simple act of doing so was enough to earn the respect and devotions of others. \nYou gain access to the <b>Natural-Born Leader</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Warrior of Truth\nEarly in your life, you learned that the philosophies of law and good not only create the best society but also reveal truths that would otherwise remain obscured. You are rarely clouded by pure dogma; instead you’re unafraid to question and create your own path toward truth, justice, and righteousness. \nYou gain access to the <b>Skeptic</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Knight-Errant\nYou know that evil stalks the world, and only one who is dedicated to the spread of good can stop these vile forces. To make sure fiends and wrongdoers do not go unpunished, you adopted the code of the paladin in order to travel the land and eradicate the wicked. Your goal is the relentless pursuit to seek out evil and put it down. \nYou gain access to the <b>Seeker</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Terrible Secret\nYou know a terrible secret about an ancient evil that threatens your homeland or perhaps even the entire world. You have sworn to keep this secret quiet lest it gain power in the retelling, but you also must work to thwart the evil whenever possible. This at times contradictory path has led you many places in your travels, and the knowledge you have gleaned from your adventures continues to serve you well in your fight against the wicked. \nYou gain access to the <b>Scholar of the Great Beyond</b> faith trait.</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="trainingRanger">
        <item><u>Training: Ranger</u>\n<i>Ranger are the hunters of legend. Although known for their ability to master varying environments and their dangers, rangers often achieve this expertise through the dedicated pursuit of their quarry. Though such a target could be a lost or kidnapped friend or a forgotten ruin, more often a ranger’s target is a hated enemy, and no feature of the class lends itself better to the establishment of character than his favored enemy. While a professional headhunter might hone his skills to track down humans or other civilized folk, a ranger whose family was murdered by ravenous orcs likely has a different set of priorities while on the hunt.\nScout, tracker or bounty hunter: what prey drives you to hunt?</i>\n</item>
        <item>An Eye for an Eye\nThe choice of your favored enemy was nothing more than simple vengeance. Perhaps you lost a loved one, family, or even a whole community to the vicious rampaging of a ferocious beast, or saw your entire homeland swallowed up by monstrous hordes. No matter the reason, your drive to hunt down and destroy creatures of their kind won’t be sated so long as even one lives. \nYou gain access to the <b>Tireless Avenger</b> faith trait and the <b>Foeslayer</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Ancient Hatred\nThe history of your people is a saga of struggle against another race. Though common among elves and orcs or dwarves and giants, many different races can have such longstanding animosity. Your choice of a favored enemy was a simple outgrowth of this racial antipathy. \nYou gain access to the <b>Knowing the Enemy</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Big Game Hunter\nWhether you sought out the thrill of hunting large prey or merely grew up in the shadows of creatures large enough to crush an entire village with a careless step, you have learned how to be quick and to size up weaknesses in those behemoths who seem to have none. \nYou gain access to the <b>Evasive Sting</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Blood Cleansing\nEither you have forsaken your kinsfolk or they have forsaken you. Maybe you grew up among a wicked or corrupt people who you needed to escape, or maybe they exiled you for being different. Whatever the case, your own kind are now your favored enemy, much to your continued chagrin or morbid amusement. \nYou gain access to the <b>Scarred Descendant</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Bounty Hunter\nYou have always been good at finding and extracting people from their hidey-holes. Most likely you hunt humanoids of either your own subtype or of one common to your region. \nYou gain access to the <b>Easy Way or the Hard Way</b> combat trait and the <b>Town Tamer</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Detached Observer\nYou set yourself apart with a pall of cold logic that allows you to see weaknesses in members of your own race that you strive not to succumb to yourself. Most likely, you pick your own race as your dominant favored enemy, and you excel as a spy or assassin paid to capture enemies of your organization. \nYou gain access to the <b>Cold and Calculating</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Divine Purpose\nNot all those who hear the voices of the gods can distill that echo into magical power like clerics or oracles. These whispers of belief encouraged you to track and hunt those creatures who pose the greatest threat to your faith. Perhaps you’re a good ranger who hunts the undead or devotes effort to slaying fiends, or you could choose to target good fey and celestials, emboldened by divine invective. \nYou gain access to the <b>Faith’s Hunter</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Nightmare Slayer\nFrom an early age, you stood up against some of the most terrifying creatures imaginable, facing off against creatures most mortals only dream of in their wildest nightmares. Possibly hailing from lands besieged by dragons or plagued by the living dead, you are not only resistant to the fear such creatures normally engender, but you live to show your enemies the face of the unafraid. \nYou gain access to the <b>Fearless Defiance</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Opportunist\nYou are an expert in creatures both common and exotic, particularly in terms of what valuable items you can harvest from their remains. The natural world exists for the benefit of those who know what to take, and you have learned how to scavenge pelts, toxins, and even rare spell componentsfrom your defeated foes. You might pick animals, magical beasts, or dragons as your dominant favored enemy—or humanoids if you’re a particularly grisly trophy collector. \nYou gain access to the <b>Harvester</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Survivalist\nYou were orphaned at a young age and left to fend for yourself in the wilds, or simply lived a life at the edge of society that required a constant scrabble for basic existence. You probably have animals or magical beasts (the edible ones) as your dominant favored enemy, and are adept at lying in wait and springing into action. \nYou gain access to the <b>Hunter’s Knack</b> combat trait.</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="trainingRogue">
        <item><u>Training: Rogue</u>\n<i>The rogue’s path is one of cunning, quickness, skill, and stealth. One of the broadest character archetypes, the rogue is found among all walks of life—from highborn spies infiltrating the courts of kings to common criminals making their livings preying on passersby in the alleys and streets. Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor.\nWhether skulking in the shadows or trying to find a better life, did you find the profession, or did it find you?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Gang War\nGrowing up in the backstreets of an urban jungle, you were forced to choose between surviving as a predator or suffering as prey. You affiliated with a guild, gang, or group of thieves and thugs, carrying out illicit missions to further their interests and sabotage those of rival gangs. \nYou gain access to the <b>Dirty Fighter</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Greed\nNo matter how much or little you had growing up, it was never enough. You discovered a talent for lifting items and coin purses from others’ belts. The world always provided for you, and when you saw something you wanted, you learned to take it. \nYou gain access to the <b>Ambitious</b> social trait and the <b>Thief of Legend</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Poverty\nIn your youth, you rarely had enough food to keep from starving. Poverty and hunger forced you to steal to survive, or to help your loved ones survive. \nYou gain access to the <b>Poverty-Stricken</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Spy\nYou’ve always had an innocent expression and a silver tongue, so naturally you were recruited as a spy during your childhood. You could have come from any social class; you might have gathered information as an urchin on the streets or acted as servant to one lord while you reported to another. \nYou gain access to the <b>Fast Talker</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>The Kill\nYou killed someone when you were relatively young. You might have done it in self-defense, in anger, or as part of an initiation ritual, and it was easier than you suspected. Afterward, some individuals or groups started paying you to kill for them, and you made a lucrative career of assassination. \nYou gain access to the <b>Killer</b> combat trait and the <b>Innocent Blood</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>The Trained\nYour early talent for feats of agility and acrobatics garnered you an experienced mentor. Impressed by your natural ability, this mentor taught you how to fight, dodge, and throw. He may have been a master thief, circus performer, fencing master, or swashbuckling pirate. \nYou gain access to the <b>Mentored</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Outlawed\nFor reasons just or unjust, you became a fugitive at an early age. You have lived outside the light of society for some time, risking capture or punishment whenever you need to break the law again. \nYou gain access to the <b>Criminal</b> social trait. See the Crime and Punishment sidebar.</item>
        <item>Thrill Seeker\nAs an adolescent, you and your friends took turns daring one another to take risks, each new challenge inspiring greater excitement. Since then, you’ve become an adrenaline junkie, performing dangerous tasks in order to chase that high. \nYou gain access to the <b>Acrobat</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Henchman\nYou’ve always worked for someone else. You do what you are told and in return you are appreciated by the boss, rewarded, and paid. \nYou gain access to either the Oathbound faith trait or the Child of the Streets social trait.</item>
        <item>Scout\nYour natural ability turned into employment in an elite squad of stealthy infiltrators.

    <string-array name="trainingSorcerer">
        <item><u>Training: Sorcerer</u>\n<i>Wielders of power on a seemingly impossible scale, sorcerers are conduits of the arcane energies inside them. These powers stem universally from the sorcerers‘ distinctive bloodlines. Either linked to powerful scions of mystical power like angels, devils, or dragons or touched by the forces of destiny themselves, sorcerers prove that sometimes when magic is involved, either you have it or you don’t.\nHow did you become aware of the forces at work within your own very blood, yearning to be unleashed?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Awakened Moment\nAt some point, the dormant power within you awakened with a fright. It might have been the first time you came close to a dragon, celestial, or genie. Or the moment could have come at the grave of a great ancestor or in a lush and verdant glen. What slumbered in your blood has never quieted, and you frequently draw upon the inspiration of your awakening. \nYou gain access to the <b>Ascendant Recollection</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Dreams of Something Different\nThe first hints of your exceptional nature came to you as fragments of remembered dreams or split-second visions. As these episodes increased in both frequency and clarity, they unlocked a power in your blood you didn’t know you had. \nYou gain access to the <b>Strength Foretold</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Failed Wizard\nAlthough your arcane aptitude was evident at an early age, you were pushed toward wizardry as the conduit for your magic. While you never mastered magic in this fashion, your time spent studying arcane tomes gave you obscure but often pertinent knowledge. \nYou gain access to the <b>Reluctant Apprentice</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>One of a Kind\nYou know that sorcerous power comes from the blood, but as far as you know, none of your ancestors possessed your gift. You keep searching for the reason for your magical powers, which has led you to greater proficiency with divinations and a keen interest in the workings of your bloodline. \nYou gain access to the <b>Knowledgeable Caster</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Outcast\nDriven away by your family and people, your arcane gifts have always inspired both fear and revulsion. You’ve become adept at spotting hostility in others who would despise you for your power. \nYou gain access to the <b>Outcast’s Intuition</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Proud Heritage\nYou hail from a long line of prominent sorcerers with even more prominent ancestral features. Your acceptance of your bloodline brings with it a pride and imposing mien that becomes amplified among others. \nYou gain access to the <b>Imposing Scion</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Shameful Heritage\nThe obvious hints of your heritage were a source of shame to your family. No matter the manifestation of your differences, being a pariah taught you to practice your arts in secret. \nYou gain access to the <b>Unseen But Not Undone</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Too Lucky\nYou’ve always had a knack for getting out of trouble. This sense of preternatural good fortune led to your inquiries into magic and the discovery of your own sorcerous powers. \nYou gain access to the <b>Fate’s Favored</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Unharmed\nAt some point in your early life, you were exposed to something dangerous like a fall into stormy waters or a spell cast your way. But instead of dying, you survived entirely unscathed. This experience either first hinted at or confirmed that you were different, marking the first step on your path to sorcery. \nYou gain access to the <b>Unscathed</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Wild Talent\nThe magic in your blood was always as uncontrollable as it has powerful. You were forced to learn control at an early age, either out of fear that your powers might hurt someone or out of remorse once they had. This relentless vigilance and self-control gave you tremendous focus and arm you with strategic methods to redirect those wild energies coursing through you. \nYou gain access to the <b>Volatile Conduit</b> magic trait.</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="trainingSummoner">
        <item><u>Training: Summoner</u>\n<i>Most, if not all, spellcasters can call to otherworldly creatures for aid, but although many learn to call increasingly powerful minions to assist them, none boast the same connection to these outsiders as summoners do. A summoner is defined by the bond formed with the single creature that acts as his eidolon. Protectors, steeds, and links to other worlds, eidolons are lifelong companions for their mortal masters. The choice to tie oneself to an eidolon and the circumstances leading to that choice form the foundation of any summoner‘s character.\nWhat caused you to forge your otherworldly bond with your trusted companion through time and space?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Abandoned\nAt some point early on, you were abandoned. This sense of loss always made you feel as though something were missing. The discovery of your eidolon and your subsequent mutual bond fostered in you the sense of companionship you’ve always longed for. \nYou gain access to the <b>Greater Link</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Caretaker\nYou met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this panicked, otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, outsider or not. \nYou gain access to the <b>Destined Diplomat</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Forced to Confront Your Own Limits\nThe bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your eidolon—whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. \nYou gain access to the <b>Desperate Speed</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Imaginary Friends\nAs a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of outsiders trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to summon your eidolon and other outsiders, these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of outsiders. \nYou gain access to the <b>Unintentional Linguist</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Monophobic\nYou were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your eidolon that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your eidolon is not with you, you know it’s never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. \nYou gain access to the <b>Perpetual Companion</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Outsider’s Lineage\nYou have the blood of outsiders in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. \nYou gain access to the <b>Planar Savant</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Pick On Someone Your Own Size\nWhen you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your eidolon trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. \nYou gain access to the <b>Twinned Presence</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Raising Gone Wrong\nYou lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the dead, but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occur… at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kin’s soul bonded with a powerful outsider on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your eidolon. Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. \nYou gain access to the <b>Loyalty across Lifetimes</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Saved by Another\nSomeone or something saved you from great danger. It might have been a family member who saved you from a precipitous fall or adventurers who saved you from a marauding monster. Your sense of gratitude fostered a strong sense of protectiveness, particularly when defending your allies or your eidolon. \nYou gain access to the <b>Dedicated Defender</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Stranger in Your Own Skin\nYou have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasn’t truly yours. Your quest to become what you’ve always felt you should be led you to your eidolon, in which you found what you see as your own idealized form. The link that you and your eidolonshare allows you to escape some of the inherent limits of your form from time to time. \nYou gain access to the <b>Linked Surge</b> magic trait.</item>
    </string-array>
    <string-array name="trainingWitch">
        <item><u>Training: Witch</u>\n<i>Some witches make pacts for their power by choice. Many more discover it by accident or circumstance.

        <item>Apprenticed\nYour development was guided by a mortal or magical creature, such as a wisewoman, hag, dryad, elf, or pixie, who instructed you in the arts of spellcasting, potions, charms, and hexes. \nYou gain access to the <b>Hedge Magician</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Desperate Accident\nYou lived an ordinary life until one day catastrophe struck and you called out desperately to any power that would come to your aid. The entity that gave you this power might be benevolent or sinister in nature, but ever since you called it, the being remains close to you. \nYou gain access to the <b>Reckless</b> combat trait.</item>
        <item>Forbidden Lore\nIn your youth, there was something you fervently desired—perhaps love, wealth, or revenge. But no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t obtain that which you coveted. Only when you turned your eye to ancient tomes and ruins and experimented with strange powers beyond your comprehension were you able to get what you wanted. \nYou gain access to the <b>Dangerously Curious</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Found Familiar\nWhen you were young, you happened upon a strange animalwith whom you forged an instant bond. It instructed you in casting spells and became your closest, most trusted companion. \nYou gain access to the <b>Animal Friend</b> gnome race trait (which you may take regardless of your race).</item>
        <item>Gifted\nYou received your magical ability as a gift from a supernatural being, such as an angel, devil, god, ancient dragon, or powerful fey. This creature expects you to act on its behalf in exchange for the power it loaned you. \nYou gain access to the <b>Magical Knack</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Inborn Power\nMany fey creatures are born with the innate ability to cast spells, and either because of having fey blood in your lineage or being born near fey lands you too were gifted this talent. \nYou gain access to the <b>Magical Lineage</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Initiated\nWhen you came of age, a coven of witches initiated you into their circle because you showed great promise. After your initiation ritual, you changed on a fundamental level. \nYou gain access to the <b>Mentored</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Invocation\nWhen you reached adolescence, you wanted power and you wanted it immediately. You didn’t have the patience or tolerance to endure endless years of boring theory and formal magical training, so you offered up your body and soul in an invocation to an entity that would grant your desire. \nYou gain access to the <b>Oathbound</b> faith trait.</item>
        <item>Possessed\nFor reasons you may never understand, an otherworldly entity took possession of you in your formative years. Since then, your mortal body has been the vessel for this mysterious power. \nYou gain access to the <b>Possessed</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Unknown\nThe circumstances by which you gained your powers are confusing, even to you. You may have received them when you stepped into a enchanted land or touched a strange artifact, or perhaps you simply awoke one day with them. You strive to find the meaning of your powers, as they drive your life in unforeseen directions. \nYou gain access to the <b>Seeker</b> social trait.</item>

    <string-array name="trainingWizard">
        <item><u>Training: Wizard</u>\n<i>Perhaps no other class exemplifies the acquisition of power through sheer focus and determination as well as the wizard. Neither touched by divine purpose nor blessed with magic in their blood, wizards must spend their entire lives studying the same texts, tomes, scrolls, and recitations to master the magical arts. Such a craft can be self-taught or instilled through instruction, learned in an academy or at the fringes of the world, but it can be mastered only through the most rigorous and regimented of study.\nHow did you come to study wizardry, and how has arcane knowledge shaped you since?</i>\n</item>
        <item>Brains over Brawn\nYou were bullied or excluded throughout your life because you lacked physical power and fighting prowess. To compensate, you turned to transmutation magic. Your practice and perseverance has granted you skill with spells of that school. \nYou gain access to the <b>Tenacious Shifting</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Dangerous Intellect\nAt a young age, those around you, whether family or friends, realized that your intellect was more than mere precociousness. As your sense of curiosity became dangerous, those responsible for you pushed you into studying magic in the hopes that you would find infinite puzzles to solve. \nYou gain access to the <b>Tireless Logic</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Fitting In\nYou hail from a long line of sorcerers or from a community known for its natural affinity for magic. Your manifestation of wizardly talent, as opposed to blood-based sorcery, caused you to hide those talents at a young age, and then to disguise them as sorcery to the best of your ability later. You still retain some tricks from this early misdirection. \nYou gain access to the <b>Shrouded Casting</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Gifted Pride\nYour affinity for magic has made you somewhat crass and arrogant, though some find your blunt disposition charming or worthy of respect. The air of superiority surrounding you is palpable and allows you to use you intellect to cow others at times when lesser individuals might barely get a word in. \nYou gain access to the <b>Bruising Intellect</b> social trait.</item>
        <item>Mortality’s Mirror\nYour childhood innocence ended the moment you realized that someday you would die. This revelation may have come to you at the deathbed of a beloved relative, during a bloody siege against your homeland, or via some other eye-opening event. You have spent the rest of your life trying to master magic in order to change this most universal fate from stealing your last breaths away. You now have a keen eye for the magic of death and for discerning answers to ancient riddles. \nYou gain access to the <b>Greater Purpose</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Righting a Wrong\nIn your youth, you witnessed an event that changed the fate of many or of a tragic few, such as a natural disaster (like a flood, hurricane, or fire) or simply a friend’s unfortunate accident during a childish game. You were burdened by the knowledge that magic—perhaps even a spell as simple as feather fall—could have changed the course of lives. You’ve dedicated yourself to magic in an effort to make sure that you are never subject to the capricious whims of fate again. \nYou gain access to the <b>Desperate Resolve</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>Storied Lineage\nYour family name is synonymous with wizardry of the highest caliber. Magic was your destined path before you were even born, and both your family and those who know of your lineage have supported this notion your entire life, granting you an unwavering confidence in your talents. While the pursuit of arcane mastery is never easy, you are driven to live up to the expectations set forth for you. \nYou gain access to the <b>Resilient Caster</b> magic trait.</item>
        <item>The Way Things Work\nMagic came alive the first time you held a magic item. The notion of extraordinary magic resting within something as seemingly ordinary as a ring, amulet, or stoppered vial changed the way you viewed the world, and ever since you’ve possessed a sense of curiosity and awe for all magic items. \nYou gain access to the <b>Magic Crafter</b> magic trait and the <b>Eldritch Researcher</b> story feat.</item>
        <item>Unpaid Debt\nSomeone saved your life at great cost. Whether through healing magic or basic heroism, your savior gave her life that you might live.

        <item>The Seer\nYou were close to a person who claimed to see the future—perhaps an oracle, seer, prophet, or merely some festival charlatan.

        <item>The Mystic\nYou were especially close to a holy person in your community who fundamentally changed your life by opening your eyes to the incredible powers that exist beyond the natural world.

        <item>The Wanderer\nYou knew someone who traveled from place to place with the changing of the wind, such as a minstrel, convict, merchant, outcast, soldier, or sailor.

        <item>Mixed Feelings\nSometimes you regret the conflict, but other times you feel as if you didn’t have a choice in the matter or that you made the right decision.

        <item>Lawful Good\nA lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. They combine a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. They tells the truth, keep their word, help those in need, and speak out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.\nLawful good combines honor with compassion.</item>
        <item>Neutral Good\nA neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. They are devoted to helping others. They work with kings and magistrates but do not feel beholden to authority figures. They excel at seeing both sides of a situation, and use this ability to inform their actions, doing what they believe will produce the most good.\nNeutral good means doing what is good and right without bias for or against order.</item>
        <item>Chaotic Good\nA chaotic good character acts as their conscience directs them with little regard for what others expect of them. They makes their own way, but are kind and benevolent. They believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. They follow their own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.\nChaotic good combines a good heart with a free spirit.</item>
        <item>Lawful Neutral\nA lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs them. Order and organization are paramount. They may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or they may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.\nLawful neutral means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.</item>
        <item>True Neutral\nA neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. They take no sides in the ideological conflict of good vs evil or law vs chaos. Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character probably thinks of good as better than evil - after all, they would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, they\'re not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.\nSome neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.\nNeutral means you act naturally in any situation, without prejudice or compulsion.</item>
        <item>Chaotic Neutral\nA chaotic neutral character follows their whims, an individualist first and last. They value their own liberty but do not strive to protect the freedom of others. They avoid authority, resent restrictions, and challenge traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those others suffer). Although unpredictable, they do not act randomly and are not as likely to jump off a bridge as they is to cross it.\nChaotic neutral represents freedom from both society’s restrictions and a do-gooder’s zeal.</item>
        <item>Lawful Evil\nA lawful evil villain methodically takes what they want within the limits of their code of conduct, but without regard for whom it hurts. They care about tradition, loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life. They play by the rules without mercy or compassion, are comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule - but are willing to serve. They condemn others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. Yet they are loath to break laws or promises.\nLawful evil represents methodical, intentional, and organized evil.</item>
        <item>Neutral Evil\nA neutral evil villain does whatever they can get away with, always out for themselves, pure and simple. They shed no tears for those they kill, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. They have no love of order and hold no illusions that following laws, traditions, or codes would make them any better or more noble. On the other hand, they lack the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.\nNeutral evil represents pure evil without honor and without variation.</item>
        <item>Chaotic Evil\nA chaotic evil character does what their greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive them to do. They are vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If theu are simply out for whatever they can get, they are ruthless and brutal. If committed to the spread of evil and chaos however, they are even worse. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as they can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate them.\nChaotic evil represents the destruction not only of beauty and life, but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.</item>

However, stuck in the body and mind you have, you feel you’re destined to fail.\nYou gain access to the <b>Doubt</b> drawback.</item>
        <item>Social Acceptance\nYou want others to accept you, to believe you’re special and worthy of merit. You are self-conscious about your social flaws and breaches of etiquette. Rejection is among your greatest fears. You might go to extraordinary lengths to be accepted by or seek favor from your peers.\nYou gain access to the <b>Dependent</b> drawback.</item>
        <item>The Future\nYour concerns lie not with the present, but with preparation for the future. You may be an avid and organized planner, or perhaps you see the signs of a coming dark age or troubled time. You behave cautiously, conservatively, and methodically as you plan for events that might one day occur.\nYou gain access to the <b>Meticulous</b> drawback.</item>
        <item>The Past\nYou long for the world to return to a past age. You’ve adopted the manners and style of this age, and are fascinated by its customs, relics, and artifacts, and by the historical figures of that time. Perhaps you live so much in this past age that your connection to the present is tenuous. Or your pretentiousness annoys others.\nYou gain access to the <b>Sentimental</b> drawback.</item>
        <item>Worldview\nIn your eyes, your moral philosophy—your alignment—is the only correct and true way of the world. Perhaps you gently pity, argue with, or brawl with those misguided souls who don’t see the world your way or by your light of reason.\nYou gain access to the <b>Provincial</b> drawback.</item>
        <item>Youth\nYou reflect upon your youth as a golden time, one ever present in your mind and that refuses to fade into the background. Every day, you feel yourself growing older and closer to your inevitable end. You seek ways to make yourself look and feel young in attempt to rekindle that fire of your adolescence, but despite your attempts, you realize that your time still draws ever nearer.\nYou gain access to the <b>Vain</b> drawback.</item>

    <!-- Faction -->
    <string-array name="faction">
        <item><u>Faction</u></item>
        <item>Aspis Consortium\nAn unscrupulous multinational trade organization based in Ostenso, Cheliax, but with interests in many parts of Avistan and Garund.</item>
        <item>Bellflower Network\nA well-established, secret society dedicated to freeing halfling slaves, usually from Cheliax, a country in which halfling slaves are specially prized and numerous. The Network maintains its own coded language and uses a blue bellflower as its symbol.</item>
        <item>Church of your deity\nTemples, shrines and churches can be found all across Golarion, futhering the ends of faiths of all alignments. Even lesser-venerated deities may wield considerable might in mortal affairs through their followers.</item>
        <item>Eagle Knights\nA state-funded military organization sworn to protect their homeland, and to destroy slavery and those who profit from it. Often working as moles inside slaving organizations, the Eagle Knights, while well intentioned, are as insidious as many of the more evil organizations in Golarion.</item>
        <item>Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye\nA very secretive organization thought to be based in Ustalav. The organization works against the Whispering Way and recently aided those responsible for defeating Kazavon, a blue dragon, who was styled the Lord of Scarwall.</item>
        <item>Free Captains\nThe leaders among the Shackles Pirates. Anyone can declare themselves a Free Captain so long as they possess a ship[1] and some control the various ports of the Shackles and have a number of other Free Captains serving under them, but the most powerful of all comprise the Shackles' ruling body: the Pirate Council.</item>
        <item>Hellknights\nA collection of knightly orders with a unique focus on the promulgation of law. They are interested less in the social goodness and charity typical of paladins, but rather in the foundation and stringent maintenance of order at all costs. In their iron-handed exaction of law, Hellknights emulate the organized and effective armies of Hell.</item>
        <item>Lantern Bearers\nAn elven organization that describes its aim as "to be a light against the coming darkness".[2][3] Their chief concerns are redeeming the drow and opposing demonic forces.</item>
        <item>Lion Blades\nA secret organization committed to protecting the interests of Taldor and its ruler, the Grand Prince. They oppose the enemies of the empire through infiltration, assassination, and espionage.</item>
        <item>Mendevian Crusaders\nA less-organised knightly order united primarily by their desire to eliminate the expansion of demons from the Worldwound. Not all of its members are selfless and honourable, but many epitomize true courage.</item>
        <item>Ninth Battalion\nAn inter-clan group of dwarf warriors dedicated to defend the remaining dwarven enclaves in Golarion. When enemies threaten a clan home, the Ninth Battalion will soon be there, answering the call for aid.</item>
        <item>Pathfinder Society\nA globe-spanning organization based out of Absalom, the City at the Center of the World. Pathfinders travel throughout Golarion and explore, delve, and otherwise experience the lesser-seen parts of the world. They send journals documenting their travels back to their venture-captains, who also assigns them new missions and suggests new places to explore.</item>
        <item>Red Mantis Assassins\nThis order of professional assassins can be distinguished by their trademark bright red and black, light armor, serrated blades (such as the sawtooth sabre), and frightful mantis masks which grant them both an enhanced sense of sight and a terrifying visage. The red dye is a reference to the colour of their god's carapace.</item>
        <item>Riftwardens\nA loose collection of planar travelers from across the Great Beyond who guard the multiverse's integrity and stability. They aim to prevent evildoers from using planar gateways and punish any who they catch trying.</item>
        <item>Varisian Wanderers\nA primarily nomadic human ethnic group known to favor the open road over permanent settlements. Sometimes called the people of the road, their traveling caravans can be encountered throughout Golarion, but Varisians also settle in permanent communities, most notably the country of Ustalav.</item>
        <item>Other racial group\nOther groups exist that further the interests of their race, whether they work together to protect their homeland, break their kin out of slavery or unite against the darkness.</item>
        <item>Other national group\nOther, lesser-known groups exist with the aim of furthering the goals of specific nations, or to hinder their less pleasant neighbours.</item>
